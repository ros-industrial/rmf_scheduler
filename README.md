## Requirements

* ROS 2 Humble
* Open-RMF (More information [here](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf))

## Documentation

Refer to the [documentation](https://rmf-scheduler.readthedocs.io/) for usage instructions.

## Quick Setup

Full setup instructions with Open-RMF can be found in the above documentation [Setup Instructions - RMF Setup](https://rmf-scheduler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup/rmf_setup.html).

Create a colcon workspace.

```bash
export COLCON_WS=~/colcon_ws
mkdir -p $COLCON_WS/src
cd $COLCON_WS
```

Download the source code.

```bash
cd src
git clone https://github.com/ros-industrial/rmf_scheduler.git
```

Clone some necessary Open-RMF packages. This upgrades `rmf_api_msgs` to `0.5.0`.
```bash
vcs import .  < rmf_scheduler/deps.repos
```

Install dependencies.
```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro $ROS_DISTRO -y
```

Build.
```bash
cd ..
colcon build
```
